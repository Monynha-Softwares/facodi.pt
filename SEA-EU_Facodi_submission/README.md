FACODI – Collaborative Documentation & Inclusive Software Platform (SSOT)
Overview

Facodi (Facility for Collaborative Documentation and Inclusivity) is an open-source software platform designed to make collaborative project documentation accessible, multilingual and inclusive. Developed under the SEA‑EU Student‑Led Projects 2026 programme, it aims to bridge the digital divide among students and researchers by providing an easy‑to‑use environment for creating, organising and translating technical documentation and project resources.

Rationale

Many existing collaboration tools assume fluency in English and access to proprietary services. This creates barriers for students from diverse linguistic and socio‑economic backgrounds. Facodi seeks to change this status quo by offering:

Multilingual documentation workflows with integrated translation support (initially Portuguese, Spanish, English and German) allowing contributors to work in their native languages while maintaining synchronised content.

Open and modular design, ensuring that modules such as task management, knowledge bases, issue tracking and resource repositories can be added or adapted according to community needs.

Low‑barrier onboarding, including tutorials, accessible interfaces and community‑led support, so that non‑technical contributors can easily participate.

Focus on inclusion and diversity, prioritising gender equality, accessibility and participation from under‑represented groups.

Objectives

Develop a functional prototype of the Facodi platform with core features such as multilingual wiki pages, task boards, real‑time collaboration and version control.

Engage an international team of SEA‑EU students from different disciplines and universities to co‑design and develop the platform, fostering intercultural understanding and peer learning.

Produce educational resources and documentation (tutorials, examples, best‑practice guides) to help future users adopt the platform.

Validate the platform through pilot projects at participating universities and gather feedback to refine the system.

Publish the platform as an open‑source project with a sustainability plan for ongoing community maintenance.

Alignment with SEA‑EU Themes

Digitalisation & collaboration – Facodi is itself a digital collaboration environment. It encourages digital competencies and supports remote teamwork across institutions.

Multilingualism & plurality – Built‑in translation workflows empower contributors to work in their preferred languages, promoting linguistic diversity.

Inclusion, diversity & gender equality – The project team and user guidelines emphasise inclusive practices, accessibility and balanced representation.

Social entrepreneurship & positive impact – By providing a free tool that lowers technical barriers, Facodi fosters knowledge sharing and community empowerment.

Project Team

Project Leader: Marcelo Santos (University of Algarve, Monynha Softwares) – software developer and community organiser responsible for project coordination, architecture and mentoring.

Core Contributors:

Maria Gómez (University of Cádiz) – UX designer and linguist contributing to user‑centred design and Spanish localisation.

Lukas Müller (Kiel University) – backend developer and DevOps specialist helping with code base and infrastructure.

Academic Mentors: Faculty members from participating universities with expertise in digital education, translation studies and social entrepreneurship (to be confirmed).

The team will remain open to additional students from other SEA‑EU universities who wish to join specific tasks (e.g. translation, testing, outreach).

Expected Outcomes and Impact

Open‑source release of the Facodi platform, licensed permissively for reuse by students and institutions.

Improved access to collaborative documentation, particularly for non‑English speakers and under‑represented groups.

Enhanced digital literacy among participating students through hands‑on experience in project management, software development and cross‑cultural communication.

Sustainable community formed around Facodi, with guidelines and governance to support future contributions and maintenance.

Transferability – other SEA‑EU projects and disciplines will be able to adapt the platform for their own needs, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.

Risk Management & Sustainability

Risks include technical challenges, coordination across time zones and maintaining engagement. To mitigate these:

Adopt an agile methodology with clear milestones and iterative deliverables.

Use collaborative tools (video meetings, chat, issue trackers) to ensure regular communication.

Engage mentors to provide guidance and resolve blockers.

Provide inclusive onboarding materials to welcome new contributors.

After the funded period, the project will seek volunteer maintainers within the SEA‑EU community and explore integration with university IT services to ensure continued hosting and updates.
