## Project name
Facodi – Collaborative Documentation & Inclusive Software Platform

## Selected SEA-EU topics
- Digitalisation and digital forms of collaborations  
- Multilingualism and plurality  
- Inclusion, diversity and gender equality  
- Social entrepreneurship and positive impact on the community/society  

## Project description (<= 3000 chars)
Current collaborative software and documentation platforms often present high entry barriers for non-English speakers, underrepresented communities and students without access to paid tools. Facodi aims to change this by providing an open-source, multilingual platform that simplifies the creation, organisation and translation of project documentation and collaborative workflows. The project will design a modular web application where users can manage tasks, share resources and co-author content in multiple languages through intuitive interfaces and real-time translation.

**Status quo / problem.** The status quo is fragmented: many SEA-EU students rely on proprietary tools that do not support multilingual collaboration, limiting participation from diverse backgrounds. Collaborative software often excludes non-English speakers and students without access to paid subscriptions, creating digital inequity within international academic networks.

**Proposed solution.** Our solution leverages community-driven development and SEA-EU networks to build a sustainable, inclusive tool for interdisciplinary projects. Facodi's aims include reducing digital inequity, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and encouraging social entrepreneurship through open technology. The platform will provide intuitive interfaces for task management, resource sharing and co-authoring content in multiple languages with real-time translation support.

**Activities.**
1) Setup & Design: Assemble the international team, define requirements, design the architecture and establish collaboration protocols.  
2) Prototype & Content Integration: Development of the core platform, integration of documentation features and initial content creation.  
3) Multilingual Collaboration & Refinement: Implement translation modules, test multilingual workflows and refine the user experience based on feedback from partner universities.  
4) Testing, Dissemination & Evaluation: Conduct beta testing with SEA-EU students, organise workshops to disseminate the platform, collect evaluations and prepare the final report.

The project aligns with SEA-EU priorities by promoting digital collaboration, multilingualism, inclusion and positive community impact through an open-source, community-driven approach.

## Project plan (<= 1500 chars)
**March–April 2026:** Setup & Design – Assemble the international team, define requirements, design the architecture and establish collaboration protocols. Set up development environment and project management tools.

**May–July 2026:** Prototype & Content Integration – Development of the core platform, integration of documentation features and initial content creation. Build modular web application with task management and resource sharing capabilities.

**August–September 2026:** Multilingual Collaboration & Refinement – Implement translation modules, test multilingual workflows and refine the user experience based on feedback from partner universities. Conduct user testing sessions.

**October–November 2026:** Testing, Dissemination & Evaluation – Conduct beta testing with SEA-EU students, organise workshops to disseminate the platform, collect evaluations and prepare the final report. Publish open-source repository and educational materials.

**Task split:**  
Leader (UAlg - Marcelo Santos) coordinates overall project roadmap, technical development, documentation and final delivery. Partner students (Maria Gómez - University of Cádiz; Lukas Müller - Kiel University) lead multilingual testing, user feedback collection and workshop facilitation. All team members share content creation and dissemination activities.

## Financial plan (<= 1500 chars)
The budget covers essential costs to develop and disseminate Facodi (total €4,000, all funded by SEA-EU programme):

**Implementation costs (€1,600):** Workshops and training sessions to co-design the platform; translation and localisation services to support multiple languages; digital tools and software subscriptions for development; community outreach events to engage users.

**Equipment costs (€1,000):** Laptop or development device for platform development; recording equipment for creating tutorials and documentation materials.

**Communication and dissemination costs (€400):** Promotional materials and digital marketing to reach the SEA-EU community; design and production of educational resources.

**Travel expenses (€1,000):** Two trips enabling team members to meet, co-develop and engage with partners at other SEA-EU universities for coordination and dissemination meetings.

All requested funds are to be provided by the SEA-EU programme; no external sources of funding are expected. We will ensure all costs follow local procurement and travel procedures.

## Practicability, impact and dissemination (<= 2000 chars)
**Practicability & risk reduction.** Facodi will deliver an open-source, multilingual documentation platform that remains available to students and faculty beyond the project's duration. To reduce risks, we will adopt agile project management with clear milestones and deliverables, hold regular virtual meetings (bi-weekly check-ins), and involve mentors from participating universities for guidance and support. Risks (technical challenges, partner drop-out, scope creep, delays) are mitigated by: (1) using proven open-source technologies and frameworks; (2) keeping all work visible in a shared repository and task board; (3) defining "minimum viable product" features early; and (4) having a backup plan focused on core platform functionality if time becomes limited.

**Impact.** By bridging language barriers and simplifying collaboration, Facodi will empower diverse student communities, encourage social entrepreneurship and enhance the overall digital literacy within the SEA-EU alliance. Students gain accessible tools for interdisciplinary collaboration regardless of language background or access to paid software. The SEA-EU community gains a sustainable, reusable platform for student-led international projects.

**Dissemination.** Project results will be reported through presentations at SEA-EU events, a public repository (openly licensed) and academic articles. The prototype will be licensed openly, allowing other students and disciplines to adapt and extend it for their projects. Outputs include: open-source codebase, educational materials and tutorials, workshop recordings, and a final report. We will share results via SEA-EU student networks and provide documentation so other communities can deploy and customize the platform.
