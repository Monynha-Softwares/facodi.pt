FACODI (Community Digital College) is a free initiative from Monynha Softwares inspired by open universities and tuned to the realities of digital learning. Our mission is simple: organise official undergraduate curricula and populate every unit with YouTube playlists and public materials, weaving a structured, accessible and collaborative learning journey. Pull up a chair, because knowledge is better when everyone can reach it.

### Purpose and values behind FACODI

- **Free access:** all content stays open, without financial barriers or hidden tricks.
- **Community:** students, teachers and volunteers curate materials collectively.
- **Transparency:** each track is linked to official curricula, ensuring credibility.
- **Inclusion and diversity:** clear language, digital accessibility and pride in our cultures.
- **Sustainability:** we reuse public resources and reduce production costs.
