FACODI (Digital Community College) is a free initiative from Monynha Softwares inspired by open universities. We organise public degree programmes, bring together community-curated resources and highlight the power of accessible learning paths.

### What guides FACODI

- **Free access:** every piece of content stays open, without paywalls or hidden tricks.
- **Community care:** students, educators and volunteers curate materials collaboratively.
- **Transparency:** each pathway is anchored in official curricula to keep trust front and centre.
- **Diversity and inclusion:** accessible language, respect for cultures and pride in our communities.
- **Sustainability:** we reuse public resources and channel energy into meaningful curation.

### Who benefits

* University students revising modules with autonomy.
* Lifelong learners looking for structured academic journeys without enrolment barriers.
* Educators and tutors who need curated playlists and readings to expand their classes.
* Everyone who believes open education transforms society.

FACODI is technology with purpose: open, community-driven and proudly inclusive thanks to Monynha Softwares. Join the journey!
