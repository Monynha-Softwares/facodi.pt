FACODI (Community Digital College) is a free initiative from Monynha Softwares, inspired by open universities and adapted to the digital education realities of Brazil. Our mission is clear: organize official curricula from degrees and related areas and fill each course unit with YouTube playlists and public materials, weaving a learning journey that is structured, accessible and collective. Come along, because good knowledge is that which everyone can reach.

### Purpose and values that guide FACODI

- **Free access:** every piece of content stays open, without financial barriers or fine print.
- **Community:** students, teachers and volunteers curate the material collectively.
- **Transparency:** each track is tied to the official curriculum, ensuring credibility.
- **Inclusion and diversity:** clear language, digital accessibility and pride in our cultures.
- **Sustainability:** we reuse existing public content and keep production costs low.

### Who is this for

* University students who want to review or deepen course units with autonomy.
* People interested in open learning who seek well-structured academic paths without needing to enroll.
* Educators and tutors who need curated collections to enrich their classes.
* Everyone who believes open education is a tool for social transformation.

### What you will find here

1. **Course catalog** based on official curricula from degrees and related fields.
2. **Detailed course units** with modules, topics, playlists and open materials.
3. **Interactive curricular map** to browse courses, semesters and disciplines without getting lost.
4. **Progress tracking** to follow what has already been studied.
5. **Version history** to register every update and guarantee academic traceability.
