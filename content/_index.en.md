FACODI (Digital Community College) is a free initiative by Monynha Softwares inspired by open universities and tuned to the vibes of digital education in Portuguese. Our mission is straightforward: organise official licentiate curricula and enrich every unit with YouTube playlists and open materials, stitching together a structured, accessible and collaborative learning journey.

Knowledge only matters when everyone can reach it, so come along, because this space is for all of us.

### Purpose and values that guide FACODI

- **Free access:** all content stays open, with no paywalls or hidden catches.
- **Community-powered:** students, educators and volunteers curate material collectively.
- **Transparency:** every track is tied to official curricula, ensuring trust and traceability.
- **Inclusion and diversity:** clear language, digital accessibility and unapologetic celebration of our cultures.
- **Sustainability:** we reuse existing public resources and keep production costs low.

### Who is this for?

* University students who want to revisit or deepen curricular units with autonomy.
* People interested in self-directed learning who want academic roadmaps without enrolment.
* Educators and tutors who need curated collections to enhance their classes.
* The whole global community that believes open education transforms reality.

### What you will find here

1. **Course catalogue** based on official licentiate curricula and related areas.
2. **Detailed curricular units** with outcomes, topics, playlists and open materials.
3. **Interactive curriculum map** to navigate courses, semesters and disciplines without getting lost.
4. **Progress tracking** so you can celebrate milestones at your own pace.
5. **Version history** to record every update and guarantee academic credibility.

FACODI is technology with purpose: free, open, proudly community-driven and glowing with Monynha Softwares energy. Shall we learn together?
