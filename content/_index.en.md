FACODI (Digital Community College) is a free initiative by Monynha Softwares inspired by open universities and tailored to the Portuguese-speaking digital education landscape. Our mission is simple: organize official curricula for teaching degrees and related areas, enrich each unit with public YouTube playlists, and weave a structured, accessible, and collaborative learning journey.

### Purpose and values guiding FACODI

- **Free access:** all content stays open with no financial barriers or fine print.
- **Community:** students, educators, and volunteers curate resources collectively.
- **Transparency:** every learning path is tied to the original curriculum for academic credibility.
- **Inclusion and diversity:** accessible language, digital accessibility, and pride in our cultures.
- **Sustainability:** we reuse open resources and reduce production costs.

### Who the project supports

* University students revising or going deeper into curricular units at their own pace.
* Lifelong learners looking for well-structured academic pathways without formal enrollment.
* Educators and mentors searching for curated content to expand their classes.
* Anyone who believes in open education as a tool for social transformation.

### What you will find here

1. **A course catalog** based on official curricula from teaching degrees and related programs.
2. **Detailed curricular units** with modules, topics, playlists, and open learning materials.
3. **An interactive curriculum map** to navigate courses, semesters, and subjects without getting lost.
4. **Progress tracking** so you can celebrate your learning achievements.
