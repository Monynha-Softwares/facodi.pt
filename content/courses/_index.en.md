FACODI organises programmes using official curriculum plans, respecting versions, semesters, and the competencies defined by each institution. Every course receives dedicated care: detailed curricular units, related topics, priority playlists, and room for the community to suggest new materials.

Learning is a collective effort—browse the catalogue, join the discussions, and help us keep higher education open and honest.
